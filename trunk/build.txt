Rocrail tarball

If you don't want to use a subversion client you can download and untar a Rocrail tarball. You also need to install the wxGTK-2.8 and wxGTK-dev package. These packages may be found in the package manager of your OS (synaptic, yum …..)

    *
      The head release can be found here: http://rocrail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rocrail/Rocrail/trunk.tar.gz?view=tar
    *
      The stable release can be downloaded here: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62652

Download the file and save it in your homedir or a subfolder of your homedir. Open a terminal, chdir to the folder where you saved the .tar.gz file and type

tar -xzvf name_of_file.tar.gz

Chdir to the new created directory “Rocrail” (if you used the head release) or “Rocrail-1.1.0” (if you downloaded the stable release). Chdir to the subfolder rocs/bin and make ogen, wgen and xml2cstr executable by typing:

chmod +x ogen

chmod +x wgen

chmod +x xml2cstr

Jump back to the new created “Rocrail” or “Rocrail-1.1.0” folder and type

make

These 3 files are compiled against debian4 so it might be that they will not work with your Linux distribution. They should work with a Debian based OS like Ubuntu and derivates. If you get in trouble with this please try :

make fromtar

Due to an error in the vision release makefile this will work only if you downloaded the head release tar file. After the compiler finished without an error you have to install the binaries by typing:

sudo make install

SVN Log

The main makefile will call the svn program to get the HEAD revisions version number to use in rocrail for tracing and info.
Problems

    *
      If you have problems compiling the rocs library, the object generator binary does not fit to your Linux system. Try make fromtar.
